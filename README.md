read alignments to [variation graphs](https://github.com/vgteam/vg).

A formal description of GRAM is described in model.md

### gramtk
The `gramtk` toolkit is really just a C++ header describing a GRAM
record implementation. It also includes a few convenience functions
for creating GRAM records from various formats.

### Suggestions, Modifications, Requests and Questions
